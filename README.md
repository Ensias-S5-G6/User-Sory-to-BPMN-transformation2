# User-Story-to-Process-Transformation-MDE

## Introduction
In contemporary software development, the translation of user stories into executable processes stands as a critical challenge. 
This project addresses this challenge by leveraging Model Driven Engineering (MDE) principles, aiming to automate the transformation
 process. The primary goal is to save time and reduce the likelihood of errors when translating user stories into process models.

## Problematic
The translation of user stories to executable process models often involves manual effort, leading to potential errors and inefficiencies.
 This project seeks to streamline and automate this translation process, enhancing accuracy and productivity in software development.
## User story Metamodel
This project utilizes a well-defined metamodel to represent user stories, a fundamental component in software development. 
The User Story Metamodel serves as a structured framework, capturing essential elements such as roles, tasks, values, and acceptance criteria.

## BPMN Metamodel

The BPMN Metamodel, a key aspect of this project, provides a standardized and comprehensive structure for
 representing business processes. It encompasses elements such as activities , process, pool, and transition. 
 This metamodel serves as the foundation for the transformation process, ensuring accurate and consistent 
 translation of user stories into BPMN models.
